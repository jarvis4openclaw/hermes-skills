# nostrX — Nostr → X/Twitter Sync

## Overview

`nostrx.py` is a Python sync tool running on **CT 202** (`192.168.100.54`). It monitors specified Nostr npubs and cross-posts new text posts to X/Twitter using the Twitter API v2 (via tweepy).

## When to Use

- Nostr posts are not appearing on X/Twitter as expected
- X posts are truncated, missing content, or cut at 280 characters without threading
- Need to change which Nostr pubkeys are monitored for cross-posting
- nostrX service is down, throwing errors, or needs a restart after config changes
- Debugging why specific posts didn't sync (checking `sync_state.json` or logs)
- Setting up a new Nostr-to-X bridge for additional npubs
- Investigating post frequency or rate-limiting issues between Nostr and X

## Not For

- **Posting directly to X/Twitter** → use `xitter` or `xurl` instead
- **Posting to Nostr** → use `nostrx` (the Nostr CLI) instead; nostrX only reads Nostr
- **Signal + Nostr scheduling** → use `signal-scheduler` instead
- **Twitter/X account management (reading, DMs)** → use `xitter` instead
- **General debugging of CT 202 or Proxmox infrastructure** → use `proxmox-host-management` instead
- **Bird CLI operations (likes, bookmarks)** → use `xitter` or `xurl` instead — the `bird` CLI on the host is read-only

**Location:** `/root/nostrX/nostrx.py`
**State file:** `/root/nostrX/sync_state.json`
**Service:** Not a systemd service — runs as a cron-triggered script
**Python venv:** `/root/nostrX/venv`

## Architecture

```
Nostr relays (wss://relay.damus.io, wss://nos.lol, etc.)
       ↓
  nostrx.py (Python, nostr_sdk)
       ↓
  Twitter API v2 (tweepy)
       ↓
  X/Twitter (@wahiddotmy)
```

- Uses **Twitter API credentials** (not bird CLI cookies) — API key/secret + access token/secret stored in `.env`
- State is tracked in `sync_state.json` to avoid duplicate posts
- Only syncs **top-level posts** (Kind 1, no 'e' or 'reply' tags)
- Skips posts with media URLs in content (extracts image URLs, uploads separately)
- 1-second delay between posts to avoid rate limiting

## Hardening (2026-08-22)

- Cron now runs `/usr/bin/python3 /root/nostrX/nostrx-wrapper.py` — a flock lockfile wrapper (`/root/nostrX/nostrx.lock`) that prevents overlapping runs, and rotates `nostrx.log` at 5MB (to `.1`).
- **Duplicate risk with scheduler — RESOLVED (2026-08-22):** scheduler npub (npub156spnm...) removed from `NOSTR_NPUBS`; only the agent npub (npub1l5khqwq...) is monitored. The scheduler on CT 200 has X-posting code ready but X's free tier is gone (see signal-scheduler skill), so it stays off unless credits are purchased.
- Free-tier credits no longer exist at all (X went pay-per-usage 2026-02-06) → every write fails with 402 indefinitely; nostrX retries the same posts each cron tick (this produced an 18.9MB log). Do NOT expect backlog draining; consider disabling nostrX entirely or buying credits.

## Common Tasks

### Run manually
```bash
ssh root@192.168.100.54 "/usr/bin/python3 /root/nostrX/nostrx-wrapper.py"
```

### View recent logs
```bash
ssh root@192.168.100.54 "tail -50 /root/nostrX/nostrx.log"
```

### Check state
```bash
ssh root@192.168.100.54 "cat /root/nostrX/sync_state.json"
```

### Change monitored npubs
Edit `.env` on CT 202:
```bash
ssh root@192.168.100.54 "nano /root/nostrX/.env"
# Find: NOSTR_NPUBS=<comma-separated npubs>
# Example: NOSTR_NPUBS=npub1xxx...,npub1yyy...
```

### Restart/reload after config change
Since it's cron-triggered, just wait for the next cron run — or kill the running instance and restart manually:
```bash
ssh root@192.168.100.54 "pkill -f nostrx.py; cd /root/nostrX && source venv/bin/activate && python nostrx.py &"
```

## Threading Behavior

Long posts (> 280 chars) are automatically posted as a proper Twitter thread:

- Posts **≤ 280 chars**: single tweet with `https://njump.me/{event_id}` appended at the end
- Posts **> 280 chars**: split into a thread via `in_reply_to_tweet_id`, each tweet ≤ 275 chars, final tweet ends with the Nostr link
- Media (images/videos) attach to the **first tweet only** (Twitter threading rule)
- Nostr link format: `https://njump.me/{event_id}`
- 1-second delay between thread tweets

Implemented via `post_thread()` method using Tweepy 4.16+ `create_tweet(in_reply_to_tweet_id=...)`.

## Investigation Notes

### Finding nostrX (debugging path)
1. signal-scheduler on CT 200 only sends to Signal + Nostr — **zero X code there**
2. The `bird` CLI (@steipete/bird) found in the environment is for **reading** likes/bookmarks, not posting
3. `/home/wahid/clawd/scripts/health-check.sh` references `nostrX (Proxmox CT 202: 192.168.100.54)` — key clue
4. nostrX is independent of signal-scheduler — it monitors Nostr pubkeys directly via relay, not the scheduler DB
5. **Search pattern used:** `find / -maxdepth 8 ... | xargs grep -l 'bird tweet'` across all CTs until /root/nostrX/nostrx.py was found
6. The actual bug location: `post_thread()` call in `run()` — old code had `if len(clean_text) > 280: clean_text = clean_text[:277] + "..."`

### CT access
- **Host:** `192.168.100.54`
- **User:** `root`
- **Auth:** SSH key — try `ssh root@192.168.100.54` (key auth configured)
- **Test:** `ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@192.168.100.54 "hostname"`

## Pitfalls

1. **SSH to CT 202 times out without key** — `ssh root@192.168.100.54` requires SSH key auth. If key forwarding isn't set up, the connection fails silently. Verify with `ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@192.168.100.54 "hostname"` before running any nostrX commands.
2. **`pkill -f nostrx.py` kills the wrong process** — Multiple Python scripts may match the pattern. Verify with `ps aux | grep nostrx.py` before killing, and use `pkill -f "python.*nostrx.py"` for a tighter match.
3. **`.env` file on CT 202 may have stale Twitter API credentials** — Twitter API v2 keys expire or get rotated. If posts stopped syncing but the script runs without error, check if the access token expired with `ssh root@192.168.100.54 "grep TWITTER /root/nostrX/.env"`.
4. **`sync_state.json` desync after manual posting** — If someone manually posts to X between nostrX runs, the state file doesn't know about it. The next run may skip a legitimate Nostr post if its event ID was already marked as synced. Clear the `last_synced_event` key to force a re-scan.
5. **Nostr relay connection failures are silent** — nostrX connects to `wss://relay.damus.io` and others; if these go down, the script exits with code 0 but syncs nothing. Check `nostrx.log` for `"Failed to connect"` or `"0 new posts"` patterns.
6. **Thread limit (25 tweets) silently drops content** — Twitter's API v2 limits threads to 25 tweets. If a Nostr post splits into >25 tweets, the excess content is lost without error. Verify post length before threading: `echo ${#clean_text}`.
7. **Media upload fails on non-image attachments** — nostrX extracts image URLs but Twitter API v2 rejects videos >140s or unsupported formats. The post appears on X without media — check the Nostr post for video/gif URLs and handle separately.
8. **Cron-triggered runs pile up if execution time > interval** — If a sync run takes 5 minutes and cron fires every 3 minutes, two instances race on `sync_state.json`. Add a lockfile (`flock`) or run interval ≥10 minutes.
9. **Nostr npub format error silently skips all posts** — If `NOSTR_NPUBS` contains a malformed npub (missing prefix, wrong checksum), nostrX may skip all entries without per-npub error reporting. Validate with `nostril <npub>` before adding.
10. **`source venv/bin/activate` fails in non-interactive SSH** — When running via `ssh root@... "source venv/bin/activate && python nostrx.py"`, the `source` may not persist. Use the venv Python directly: `ssh root@192.168.100.54 "/root/nostrX/venv/bin/python /root/nostrX/nostrx.py"`.

| Service | CT | Port | Purpose |
|---------|-----|------|---------|
| signal-scheduler | 200 (192.168.100.47) | 3000 | Signal + Nostr scheduling |
| nostrX | 202 (192.168.100.54) | — | Nostr → X sync |
| nostr.js CLI | CT 200 + local | — | Direct Nostr posting CLI |

nostrX is the cross-post layer that reads from Nostr (not the scheduler DB) and posts to X. signal-scheduler handles Signal + Nostr posting only.
