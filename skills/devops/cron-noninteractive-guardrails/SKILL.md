# Cron Non-Interactive Guardrails
## When to Use

- Running a cron job that performs health checks, keepalives, or single-command verification
- Debugging recurring `Inappropriate ioctl for device` or `no job control in this shell` errors in cron output
- Encountering command timeouts after the primary check already succeeded
- Setting up new cron jobs and want to avoid TTY-dependent patterns from the start
- A cron job is running extra post-success commands that trigger false alarms
- Preventing `brv curate` from hanging due to `tcsetattr`/`ioctl` issues in cron
- Writing Python HTTP scripts for cron where urllib hangs on IPv6

## Not For

- **Interactive debugging sessions** → cron guardrails don't apply; use `node-inspect-debugger` or `python-debugpy`
- **Long-running background services (not cron-triggered)** → use `cron-model-optimization` for model selection, not guardrail patterns
- **General shell scripting outside cron** → these patterns are cron-specific; use `systematic-debugging` for generic shell debugging
- **CI/CD pipeline failures** → CI runners typically have PTY allocation; use `github-pr-workflow` or `github-code-review`
- **Performance optimization of working scripts** → guardrails prevent failures, not optimize throughput
- **Non-cron scheduled tasks (systemd timers, at jobs)** → these have different TTY behavior; verify before applying cron-specific patterns

## Core rule
If the primary check succeeds and no issue is requested, **stop immediately** and return `[SILENT]` (or the required success format). Do not run extra context/cleanup commands.

## Steps
1. Run exactly the primary command in foreground mode.
2. Parse success/failure from that command only.
3. On success with "report only on issue" instruction: return `[SILENT]` immediately.
4. On failure: report only actionable failure details (exit code + key error line).
5. Never run interactive shell patterns in cron (`bash -i`, job-control assumptions, TTY-dependent tools).

## API Key Access in Cron

**Critical:** Keys in `~/.hermes/.env` may be credential-manager-backed (masked as `***` in display, short length when parsed). They will NOT be available to subprocess API calls (litellm, openai SDK, etc.) even after `source ~/.hermes/.env` — the value exported is the masked stub, not the real key.

**Workarounds:**
- Store a dedicated plaintext service key in `~/.hermes/evolution-creds.env` (not the main `.env`) and `source` that specifically for cron jobs that need API access.
- Or pass the key via the cron job's environment variable configuration in `~/.hermes/cron/jobs.yaml`.
- Diagnose: `python3 -c "open('/home/wahid/.hermes/.env').read()" | grep KEY_NAME` — if len < 20 chars or contains `***`, the key is masked.

## Anti-patterns to avoid
- Running extra CLI helpers after a successful health check.
- Calling tools that expect TTY/job control in cron.
- Extending runtime with non-essential commands that can timeout and create false alarms.
- Running `brv curate` synchronously in cron; it can trigger shell/job-control (`tcsetattr`/ioctl) issues.

## Python urllib IPv6 Hang

**Symptom:** Python scripts using `urllib.request` to call external HTTPS APIs hang indefinitely (30s+ timeout) even though `curl` to the same URL works in <1s.

**Cause:** Python's `urllib` attempts IPv6 first. If the environment has broken IPv6 (no route, silent drop), the connection hangs until timeout. `curl` handles IPv4/IPv6 fallback correctly.

**Fix:** In Python scripts that need HTTP, use `subprocess.run(["curl", ...])` instead of `urllib.request`:

```python
import subprocess, json

def fetch_json(url):
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["curl", "-s", "--connect-timeout", "15", "--max-time", "30",
         "-H", "User-Agent: hermes-agent/1.0", url],
        capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=35
    )
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"curl failed: {result.stderr.strip()}")
    return json.loads(result.stdout)
```

This applies to cron scripts, detection scripts, and any Python code making outbound HTTP calls.

## Reference: OpenRouter Free Model Detection

See `references/openrouter-free-model-detection.md` for a complete example of this pattern — a cron-driven external API monitor that tracks new/expired free models with human-in-the-loop notifications.

## Tool-specific guardrail (ByteRover CLI)

### Binary path
The brv CLI is at `/home/wahid/.npm-global/bin/brv` (NOT `~/.brv-cli/bin/brv`). Always use the full path in cron.

### Authentication
`brv curate` requires a connected provider. Without authentication, it fails with "No provider connected."

**Setup (one-time, interactive):**
```
brv login -k <api-key>   # get key at https://app.byterover.dev/settings/keys
```
Or use a swarm provider:
```
brv swarm onboard    # then: brv swarm curate "<content>" --provider local-markdown:notes
```

### Runtime flag
When auth IS configured, run `brv curate` with `--detach` (and optionally `--format json`) to queue and exit cleanly. Report queued `taskId` as proof of execution instead of waiting on interactive progress output.

### Auth-blocker fallback (when brv can't authenticate in cron)
When `brv login` hasn't been run and `brv swarm onboard` hasn't been set up, `brv curate` is blocked. **Do not abort the curation task.** Instead, write curated knowledge directly to the context tree filesystem:

1. Create a category directory if needed: `mkdir -p ~/.brv/context-tree/<category>/`
2. Write a well-formatted markdown file: `~/.brv/context-tree/<category>/<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Include: title, date, context, problem, root cause, fix, tags
4. Log the auth gap and fallback action in `~/autonomy-gaps.md`

This preserves the knowledge and makes it discoverable by the context tree system, even though it bypasses the AI-powered curation/routing that `brv curate` normally provides.

## Sync Script Deduplication
Any scheduled sync that creates API resources must deduplicate by content key (title+date), not just sync state files. Sync state drifts — always verify against the live API. See `references/sync-script-dedup-pattern.md` for the full pattern and a real Notion→Outlook example.

## Verification next run
- Query sessions for: `"Inappropriate ioctl" OR "no job control" OR "timed out after"`.
- Expect zero new matches in successful health-check runs.
- Confirm successful checks end immediately after the primary command result.

## Pitfalls

1. **Foreground `terminate` after success triggers ioctl** — Calling any tool after the primary check succeeds can pull in shell initialization that tries to allocate a TTY. If the main check passes, return immediately — no follow-up tools, no cleanup, no status echo.
2. **`source ~/.hermes/.env` exports masked stubs, not real keys** — The `.env` file's credential-manager-backed keys appear as `***` when sourced, so subprocesses get a 5-char stub instead of the real key. Always use a dedicated plaintext creds file (`evolution-creds.env`) or pass keys via cron job env vars in `jobs.yaml`.
3. **`brv curate` without `--detach` hangs on tcsetattr** — The `brv` CLI tries to allocate a TTY for interactive progress even when there's no terminal. Always pass `--detach --format json` and report the returned `taskId` instead of waiting for output.
4. **`bash -i` or interactive flags in cron scripts** — Any shell flag that requests job control (`-i`, `-l`) will fail with `no job control in this shell`. Use `#!/bin/bash` without interactive flags and avoid `set -m`.
5. **Python `urllib.request` hangs on IPv6 in cron environments** — The standard library tries IPv6 first and hangs if the network silently drops IPv6. Replace with `subprocess.run(["curl", ...])` which handles dual-stack fallback correctly, or monkey-patch `socket.getaddrinfo` to force AF_INET.
6. **Post-success logging that uses `tee` or pipes** — Piping through `tee` or `| while read` in a script can create subshells that exit early or hang in cron. Log directly to files with `>>` redirection or use `script -c` with `-q` for capturing output.
7. **`terminal(pt=true)` on cron jobs that don't need it** — PTY mode forces a pseudo-terminal allocation that can trigger TTY-dependent code paths in tools like `brv`. Only use `pt=true` when genuinely needed (interactive CLIs that refuse to run without a TTY).
8. **Long-running checks that don't set `timeout`** — Cron jobs default to a 180s timeout in Hermes but some API calls (OpenRouter IPv6 hang) can exceed this. Always set explicit `timeout` on terminal calls and use `--connect-timeout 15 --max-time 30` for curl calls.
9. **`gh auth` interactive prompts in cron** — GitHub CLI's auth flow requires a browser or TTY. If a cron job tries `gh auth login`, it will hang waiting for input. Pre-authenticate with `gh auth setup-git` once, then rely on the stored token.
10. **Mixing cron guardrails with `cron-model-optimization`** — The model optimization skill handles provider/model selection for cost efficiency; the guardrails skill handles non-TTY execution patterns. Confusing the two leads to running a cheap local model with an interactive TTY flag, defeating both.
