# Cal.com API v2

This skill provides guidance for AI agents to interact with the Cal.com API v2, enabling scheduling automation, booking management, and calendar integrations.

## When to Use

- Building an integration that needs to programmatically create, list, or cancel bookings
- Checking real-time availability (slots) for an event type before presenting booking options
- Setting up webhooks to receive real-time notifications for booking lifecycle events
- Managing event type configurations (duration, location, availability rules) via API
- Syncing calendars or retrieving busy times to avoid double-booking
- Automating rescheduling workflows where a booking UID needs to be updated
- Platform/OAuth integrations managing scheduling on behalf of multiple users

## Not For

- **Manual booking via a UI** → Cal.com has its own web interface; use the API only for programmatic access
- **Google Calendar or Outlook sync** → use `google-workspace` for GCal or Cal.com's built-in calendar connections
- **General-purpose HTTP API debugging** → use `systematic-debugging` for generic API troubleshooting
- **Email scheduling workflows** → use `himalaya` for email-based scheduling or Cal.com's email notifications
- **Payment/Stripe integration in bookings** → Cal.com handles payments natively; use only if extending custom payment flows
- **Scheduling for services not on Cal.com** → this API is specific to Cal.com's infrastructure; use `notion` or `google-workspace` for other scheduling backends

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:
```
https://api.cal.com/v2
```

## Required Credentials

| Environment Variable | Required | Description |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|
| `CAL_API_KEY` | Yes | Cal.com API key (prefixed with `cal_live_` or `cal_test_`). Used as Bearer token for all API requests. Generate from Settings > Developer > API Keys. |
| `CAL_CLIENT_ID` | No | OAuth client ID for platform integrations that manage users on behalf of others. Sent as `x-cal-client-id` header. |
| `CAL_SECRET_KEY` | No | OAuth client secret for platform integrations. Sent as `x-cal-secret-key` header. |
| `CAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | No | Secret for verifying webhook payload signatures via the `X-Cal-Signature-256` header. |

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication via Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer cal_<your_api_key>
```

For detailed authentication methods including OAuth/Platform authentication, see `references/authentication.md`.

## Core Concepts

**Event Types** define bookable meeting configurations (duration, location, availability rules). Each event type has a unique slug used in booking URLs.

**Bookings** are confirmed appointments created when someone books an event type. Each booking has a unique UID for identification.

**Schedules** define when a user is available for bookings. Users can have multiple schedules with different working hours.

**Slots** represent available time windows that can be booked based on event type configuration and user availability.

## Reference Documentation

This skill includes detailed API reference documentation for each domain:

| Reference | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `references/authentication.md` | API key and OAuth authentication, rate limiting, security best practices |
| `references/bookings.md` | Create, list, cancel, reschedule bookings |
| `references/event-types.md` | Configure bookable meeting types |
| `references/schedules.md` | Manage user availability schedules |
| `references/slots-availability.md` | Query available time slots |
| `references/calendars.md` | Calendar connections and busy times |
| `references/webhooks.md` | Real-time event notifications |

## Quick Start

### 1. Check Available Slots

Before creating a booking, check available time slots:

```http
GET /v2/slots?startTime=2024-01-15T00:00:00Z&endTime=2024-01-22T00:00:00Z&eventTypeId=123
```

See `references/slots-availability.md` for full details.

### 2. Create a Booking

```http
POST /v2/bookings
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "start": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "eventTypeId": 123,
  "attendee": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "timeZone": "America/New_York"
  }
}
```

See `references/bookings.md` for all booking operations.

### 3. Set Up Webhooks

Receive real-time notifications for booking events:

```http
POST /v2/webhooks
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "subscriberUrl": "https://your-app.com/webhook",
  "triggers": ["BOOKING_CREATED", "BOOKING_CANCELLED"]
}
```

See `references/webhooks.md` for available triggers and payload formats.

## Common Workflows

**Book a meeting**: Check slots -> Create booking -> Store booking UID

**Reschedule**: Get new slots -> POST /v2/bookings/{uid}/reschedule

**Cancel**: POST /v2/bookings/{uid}/cancel with optional reason

## Best Practices

1. Always check slot availability before creating bookings
2. Store booking UIDs for future operations (cancel, reschedule)
3. Use ISO 8601 format for all timestamps
4. Implement webhook handlers for real-time updates
5. Handle rate limiting with exponential backoff

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing `CAL_API_KEY` env var returns 401 with misleading message** — Cal.com's API returns a generic "Unauthorized" without indicating which header is missing. Always verify the env var is set and matches the expected `cal_live_` or `cal_test_` prefix before making calls.
2. **Wrong timezone in `attendee.timeZone` causes off-by-hours bookings** — If the attendee's timezone is omitted or wrong, Cal.com defaults to UTC, creating bookings at unexpected times. Always pass `timeZone` in IANA format (e.g., `"America/New_York"`, not `"EST"`).
3. **Slot query without `eventTypeId` returns 400** — The `/v2/slots` endpoint requires `eventTypeId` as a query parameter. Omitting it or passing a string "123" instead of integer 123 returns a 400 without clear guidance.
4. **Booking UID lost after creation** — The `uid` returned in the booking response (not the `id`) is required for cancel and reschedule operations. Store it immediately; the numeric `id` alone won't work for `/v2/bookings/{uid}/cancel`.
5. **Webhook signature verification fails with raw body** — The `X-Cal-Signature-256` header is an HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body. If your framework parses JSON before verification, the signature won't match. Buffer the raw body first, then parse.
6. **Rate limiting returns 429 with `Retry-After` in seconds, not milliseconds** — Cal.com's rate limit headers use seconds. An exponential backoff starting at 1s, doubling to 8s max, handles most rate limit scenarios without burning retries on millisecond-scaled waits.
7. **`eventTypeId` from the UI differs from API** — Event type IDs in the Cal.com dashboard URL may differ from the API-returned ID if the event type was duplicated or imported. Always fetch from `GET /v2/event-types` to get the authoritative API ID.
8. **OAuth platform integrations need both `x-cal-client-id` and `x-cal-secret-key`** — Sending only the client ID without the secret key causes a 403 "Insufficient permissions" on user-scoped endpoints. Both headers are required for any `/v2/organizations/{orgId}/` or user-management call.
9. **Booking with past `start` time returns 422** — Cal.com rejects bookings where `start` is in the past, even by seconds. Always validate `start > Date.now()` before POSTing, and include a buffer of at least 60 seconds for clock skew.
10. **Pagination uses cursor-based tokens, not page numbers** — `GET /v2/bookings` returns a `nextCursor` string, not a `page` number. Passing `page=2` is silently ignored; use `cursor={nextCursor}` to paginate. The last page returns `nextCursor: null`.
